# Democrasim Introduction

**Democrasim** is a Python package for simulating how interventions
(e.g., civics education) affect voter behavior and election outcomes,
which in turn shape policy metrics (QALYs, inequality, economic growth, etc.).

This Jupyter Book provides demonstrations on how to use `democrasim`.
